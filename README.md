# Predicting-the-Success-of-Bank-Telemarketing
The objective of this project was to build an ML model that can predict the success of the bank's telemarketing campaign, which aims to make customers subscribe to a term deposit scheme. Each such success receives a 'yes' label. The data pertains to a banking institution's direct marketing campaigns, which were based on phone calls.
